This project showcases a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing palindrome checker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application leverages JavaScript for the core logic that checks if a given input is a palindromeâ€”meaning it reads the same backward as forward. The HTML structure forms the backbone of the webpage, allowing for easy input and output display, while the CSS enhances the overall user experience through visually appealing styles and responsive design. Users can simply enter a word or phrase, and the checker will instantly validate whether it is a palindrome, making it an engaging and educational tool for anyone interested in linguistics and programming.
